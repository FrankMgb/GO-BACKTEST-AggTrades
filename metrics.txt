Yes. If you apply this checklist rigorously to the mathematical framework we defined (the functions of

), you will have a complete, institutional-grade answer to "Is this math actually money?"

This checklist is essentially the "Gate 1" Approval Protocol used by major HFT/MFT firms. If a signal passes this, it moves to production. If it fails, it is discarded, no matter how elegant the math was.

However, given your specific 200 ms latency constraint and the aggTrades only restriction, I need to add three specific "lethal" modifications to this checklist. Without these, you might get a false positive (a signal that looks good in Python but bleeds money in live execution).

Here is the refined "200ms-Robust" Validation Framework:

1. The "Latency Cliff" Test (The most critical check for you)

Your checklist mentions adding 10–50 ms delay. That is standard HFT. For you, that is not enough.

The Modification:
You must shift your target variable 
𝑅
𝑡
,
𝐻
R
t,H
	​

 (future return) by exactly 
200
ms
+
𝛿
200ms+δ
.

The Test: Compute IC and Sharpe where the trade is executed at 
𝑡
+
200
ms
t+200ms
.

The Danger: Many microstructure signals (like simple OFI) have a "half-life" of roughly 50–100ms. They might show an IC of 0.15 at 0 lag, but an IC of 0.01 at 200ms lag.

Requirement: The signal decay curve must be convex or flat enough that significant positive IC remains at 
𝑡
+
250
ms
t+250ms
. If the signal relies on "reacting fast," this test will kill it immediately.

2. The "Signal Flicker" / Turnover Cost Test

Mathematical signals often oscillate wildy. You cannot afford to flip your position 5 times a second with 200ms latency.

The Modification:
Measure the Autocorrelation of the Signal (
𝐴
𝐶
𝐹
ACF
) at lag 200ms.

Metric: 
Corr
(
𝑆
𝑡
,
𝑆
𝑡
+
200
ms
)
Corr(S
t
	​

,S
t+200ms
	​

)

The Logic: If your signal says "Buy" at 
𝑡
t
 and "Sell" at 
𝑡
+
100
ms
t+100ms
, you are dead. You will execute the Buy just as the signal flips to Sell.

Requirement: Your signal needs high persistence. You are looking for "regime" signals (e.g., "heavy sweeping has started") rather than "tick" signals.

Fix: If ACF is low, you must apply a smoothing kernel (EWMA) or a hysteresis threshold to the raw math function until the ACF improves, then re-check if the IC (Point 1) is still there.

3. The "Non-Linearity" Check (Crucial for TradeCount)

Your checklist Point 3 (Monotone Deciles) assumes a linear relationship. The TradeCount math is highly non-linear.

The Modification:
Check for "Hockey Stick" conditional returns.

The Math: Standard OFI is linear. But TradeCount (fragmentation) usually does nothing for values 1–10, and then explodes for values > 50.

The Test: When binning your deciles, ensure the top bin (Decile 10) is further split.

Look at the top 1% or top 0.1% of signal values.

Why: You might find that Deciles 1–9 have 0 edge, and all the edge is in the top 1% (extreme liquidation/whale events).

Action: If this is true, you stop trading a continuous signal and switch to an "Event Trigger" system (only trade when 
𝑆
𝑡
>
Threshold
S
t
	​

>Threshold
).

Summary: How to map the Math to the Checklist

Here is the direct mapping of your theoretical primitives to the validation:

, and then force them through this 9-point checklist with a 200ms lag applied to the target, you will know the truth.

If the Net Sharpe > 1.5 and IC @ 200ms > 0.02 (approximate threshold for viability), you have found a signal that survives the "latency valley of death."

Understood. Here is a **tight, “no-noise” checklist**: if your OFI / microstructure signal looks good on these, you can be legitimately confident it has real, live-tradable information.

Think of this as the **minimum viable performance report** for a short-horizon signal.

---

## 1. Out-of-sample IC (Information Coefficient)

**What:** Correlation between signal (S_t) and future mid-return (R_{t,H}), computed **out-of-sample** and in **rolling windows**.

* Metrics:

  * Pearson IC: `corr(S_t, R_{t,H})`
  * Rank IC (Spearman): `corr(rank(S_t), rank(R_{t,H}))`
* Requirements:

  * Positive, statistically significant (t-stat > ~3 over long history).
  * Stable across time (no huge regime flips).
* Why critical: This is the primary measure of predictive power. If IC is weak or unstable, everything else is cosmetic.

---

## 2. Hit rate of direction vs 50% baseline

**What:** Fraction of times the signal gets the **sign** of the future move right.

* Metric:

  * `HitRate = P(sign(S_t) = sign(R_{t,H}))`
* Requirements:

  * Out-of-sample hit rate meaningfully > 50%.
  * Confidence interval does not overlap 50% by chance (binomial test).
* Why critical: Converts correlation into an intuitive “how often am I right?” measure; useful for sanity vs implementation frictions.

---

## 3. Monotone conditional return curve (deciles)

**What:** Average future return by **signal bucket**.

* Procedure:

  * Bin (S_t) into K quantiles (e.g., 10 deciles).
  * For each decile k, compute:

    * ( \mathbb{E}[R_{t,H} \mid S_t \in Q_k] )
* Requirements:

  * Clear, roughly monotone increasing curve from low to high deciles.
  * Extremes (top/bottom deciles) show strongest positive/negative average returns.
* Why critical: Ensures the mapping “larger signal ⇒ larger expected move” is structurally sound, not just noise from linear correlation.

---

## 4. Mutual Information (MI) / Normalized MI between signal and returns

**What:** Pure information-theoretic value of the signal.

* Setup:

  * Discretize future return (R_{t,H}) into classes (e.g., Down / Flat / Up or quantiles).
  * Discretize signal (S_t) into quantile bins.
* Metrics:

  * Mutual Information:
    ( I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X) )
  * Normalized MI:
    ( \text{NMI} = I(X;Y) / H(Y) )
* Requirements:

  * MI > 0 and stable over time.
  * NMI positive and persistent across days / regimes (even small but robust is valuable).
* Why critical: Answers “how many bits of uncertainty about future returns does this signal actually remove?” — the pure information view.

---

## 5. Δ Log-loss (Cross-entropy improvement vs baseline)

**What:** How much better your **probability forecasts** are compared with no signal.

* Baseline model:

  * Predict class probabilities of (Y) (future return class) from unconditional frequencies.
* Signal model:

  * Predict (p_\theta(Y_t | S_t)) (e.g., logistic or softmax model).
* Metric:

  * Average log-loss / cross-entropy for baseline vs signal model.
  * ΔLogLoss = baseline_loss – signal_loss.
* Requirements:

  * ΔLogLoss positive, statistically significant, and stable over time.
* Why critical: Equivalent to an information gain measure under a model; directly connected to mutual information and usable for model comparison.

---

## 6. Out-of-sample Sharpe after realistic microstructure costs

**What:** Economic value of the signal when traded in a simple way.

* Setup:

  * Simple strategy: trade in direction of signal (e.g., sign(S_t)), hold for horizon H, incorporate:

    * Spread cost
    * Estimated impact / slippage
    * Fees/rebates
* Metrics:

  * Net Sharpe ratio (annualized or per sqrt(hour/day)).
  * Hit rate of trades (P&L > 0).
* Requirements:

  * Positive Sharpe after costs, robust across time.
  * P&L not dominated by a few outlier periods.
* Why critical: Confirms that the information you measure is not fully eaten by trading frictions.

---

## 7. Risk profile: drawdown and tail behavior

**What:** “Can I survive trading this signal?”

* Metrics:

  * Max drawdown of strategy P&L.
  * Skewness, tail percentiles of trade returns.
  * Ratio of average win to average loss.
* Requirements:

  * Drawdowns acceptable for your leverage/risk.
  * Loss tail behavior understood and not catastrophic for realistic sizing.
* Why critical: You need confidence not just in edge but in survivability.

---

## 8. Stability across time & regimes (IC / MI / Sharpe by slice)

**What:** Does the signal die in certain environments?

* Slices:

  * By day / week / month.
  * By volatility regime (low/med/high).
  * By spread regime (1-tick vs wider) and time of day.
* Metrics:

  * Distribution of IC, MI, and Sharpe across slices.
* Requirements:

  * Majority of slices show positive IC / MI / Sharpe.
  * Weakness in some regimes is okay, complete collapse is not.
* Why critical: Live trading is about **stability**; if performance is concentrated in a tiny subset of history, confidence should be low.

---

## 9. Horizon decay / alpha half-life

**What:** Does the information behave as a short-horizon microstructure edge?

* Metrics:

  * IC, hit rate, MI, Sharpe for 5s, 10s, 20s horizons (and maybe 40s).
* Requirements:

  * Clear, interpretable decay as horizon increases.
  * Shape of decay consistent with microstructure intuition (strong at very short horizon, weaker as noise accumulates).
* Why critical: Confirms you are truly extracting high-frequency structure, not a fragile artifact.

---

### How to use this list

If you can honestly say, **out-of-sample**:

1. IC & hit rate are positive, statistically solid, and stable.
2. Decile conditional returns are monotone with strong extremes.
3. MI / NMI and Δ log-loss vs baseline are persistently > 0.
4. Net Sharpe after realistic costs is positive and not concentrated in a tiny window.
5. Risk (drawdown/tails) is acceptable for your sizing.
6. All of the above roughly hold across different days/regimes and show a coherent horizon decay.

Latency fingerprint consistencyYour backtest assumes you react at the exact same millisecond as the signal is generated. In production you have 5–50 ms extra latency and jitter.Add 10 ms, 20 ms, 50 ms artificial delay to signal execution in the backtest. IC and Sharpe curves must decay gracefully, not collapse from +8 → –2 the moment you add 15 ms. Most academic-style signals die here.
